ðŸŒŸ Excited to Share My Latest Project! ðŸŒŸ
I recently completed a project on Coursera titled "Build a Portfolio Website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript." This hands-on project allowed me to deepen my understanding of front-end development and create a fully functional, responsive portfolio website from scratch. ðŸš€
Key highlights of the project:
HTML: Structured content with semantic elements.
CSS: Designed and styled the website with modern techniques.
JavaScript: Added interactivity and dynamic features.
Feel free to check out my portfolio and let me know your thoughts!
